KEY FINDINGS
-----------
1. Agent Count Effects:
   - Optimal agent count across all experiments: 3
   - Performance ranking by agent count (best to worst): 3, 5, 10

2. Strategy Effects:
   - Best performing strategy across all experiments: basic
   - Performance ranking by strategy (best to worst): basic, communication, stigmergy

3. Environmental Effects:
   - Performance ranking by obstacle density (best to worst): 0.25, 0.15, 0.05

4. Communication Effects:
   - Performance ranking by communication range (best to worst): Unlimited, 2.0, 5.0

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------------
Based on the experimental results, the basic strategy with 3 agents appears to offer the best balance of efficiency and coverage.

Special consideration: Different strategies perform better in different environments:
  - communication is best for obstacle density 0.05
  - basic is best for obstacle density 0.15
  - communication is best for obstacle density 0.25

Further research could explore adaptive strategies that select the appropriate coordination method based on environmental conditions and available resources.
