**Author:** William Smith  
**Institution:** University of Nottingham  
**Study Period:** April - August 2025  
**Total Trials Conducted:** 135+ experimental runs

---

## 1. Research Objectives

### 1.1 Primary Research Questions

1. **Strategy Effectiveness:** How do different coordination strategies (basic, stigmergy, communication) affect mission completion time and area coverage in search and rescue scenarios?

2. **Scalability Analysis:** What is the optimal number of agents for different coordination strategies, and how does performance change with team size?

3. **Environmental Impact:** How does environmental complexity (obstacle density) affect the relative performance of different coordination strategies?

4. **Communication Constraints:** How do communication range limitations impact the effectiveness of communication-based coordination?

### 1.2 Hypotheses

**H1:** Communication-based coordination will significantly outperform basic and stigmergy strategies in terms of mission completion time and area coverage.

**H2:** The performance advantage of advanced coordination strategies will increase with environmental complexity (higher obstacle density).

**H3:** There exists an optimal team size (5-7 agents) where coordination benefits are maximized while avoiding diminishing returns from coordination overhead.

**H4:** Communication range constraints will significantly impact coordination effectiveness, with performance degrading as communication radius decreases.

## 2. Experimental Design

#### **Phase 2: Environmental Impact Analysis**  
- **Objective:** Assess strategy robustness across environmental complexities
- **Variables:**
  - Independent: Coordination strategy (3 levels), Obstacle density (3 levels)
  - Dependent: Completion time, coverage efficiency, success rate
